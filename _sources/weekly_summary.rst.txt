Answers to Weekly Summary questions
===================================

Week 4
~~~~~~~

- I was wondering what the best way to write our ptriples function is, as far as using nested for loops or a diff way etc.

nested loops will work very well for that

- From this code, even=[k for k in range(-99,100) if k%2==0] print(even)  What does it mean k for k?

It means append k to the list, for each k in range ...

- for drawing the pictures, there are so many plt methods such as plot, axis, yticks, figures. how we compare them when we drawing a picture.

You will just call what you need to use. ``plot`` to plot a curve, ``figure`` to change the figure properties, and so on ... 
With a little practice it will become very natural.

- Are you more lenient on the first projects since we don't have any feedback yet regarding what we are doing wrong. I'm also not sure how slices work.

Not really (maybe only a little). I have been going over what is expected for the project several times in class. However I plan to return you project 1 before project 2 deadline, so that you can have feedback to improve in project 2. For the slicing, there is some material on the class website, or you can come to office hours.

- Can you provide an example in class of part of code where it has all the elements for a decent project layout? Such as the intro to a specific cell or code, comments within the cell, and then if there needs to be an analysis after, what would you recommend us mentioning?  As for projects, when would you prefer us emailing them to you if we want to receive some feedback? Mostly in regards to the comments and analysis in-between the codes.

Examples of good projects are posted on the class website. You should look into that, and come to office hours if you have questions. To receive feedback on the project expect it can take me up to a couple of days to look into what you send me. So plan accordingly.

- Where can we find all the list of commands we can use when building a graph?

google "plt.plot" it should give you a place to start.

- For this week, we studied "Plotting with matplotlib" and we tried to use this knowledge to draw a circle. Is there any solution to draw others diagram. For example, like triangle and square.

Sure. For a square you just need vertical and horizontal lines, the triangle is a little trickier, but not too bad. You could sketch lines once you know the correct slope.

- Do you have a minimum/maximum size recommendation for graphs or any other stylization preferences?

Usually (6,6), or (8,6)  or (10,8) are good sizes. i look for completeness rather than style. Labels, title, lengend,...

- Are there any sources we can use to do research for projects other than our notes from class?

You can look online to find more information on the topic of the project. However careful not to copy text/code

- a question i have would be why do the marker labels sometimes not work when makign a graph.

Can you show me an example?

- When is the ";" required when writing the code for plots?

On the last ``plt`` command you run

- I am wondering if I can add some notes or comments in the corner of the figure that is plotted by plt.plot() function? 

There is a ``plt.text`` command that allows for that.

- Can we have an answer sheet of weekly quiz? 

You can test all of the python part by just running the code in the notebook, and I will be happy to answer any question on the code at office hours.

- Will we have time to work on the project Wednesday in class?

We will work on the project for sure on Monday. IDK about Wednesday

- Does compressing lists make them more efficient to run on Python, or is it mainly to make the code look cleaner? 

Cleaner code

- The part where we learnt how to print names with greetings, what would the could look like,  if we wanted to print each sentence in a new line?

That code was just building the list. To print each greeting on a new line you can do a loop with a print command inside.

- Is it fine to use list comprehension if the codes are too long?

It is not wrong, but the code will not look nice. Keep in mind that code readability is very important.

- When plotting graphs, how do we name the axis' and give the graph a title? How did you plot the x and y axis title?

plt.ylabel for the y-axis, plt.title for the title 

- What is the purpose and usage of -= and +=. I am having some issues figuring this out.

``x+=2`` is the same as ``x=x+2`` just more concise.

- We used a for loop to define a variable in a graph. Will we use a while loop to do something similar? 

Do you mean list comprehension? While loops do not work in list comprehension.

- Are the grade cutoffs on the website ever adjusted based on the class average?

No, I do not curve grades

- Can we do a project relating to manipulating a data set.  Like a data science based project?

We might do something close to that. I haven't decided yet what the last couple of projects will be.

- In class I worked on the pythagorean theorem project code and successfully was producing pythagorean triples. But, I also had [0,0,0] as a triple and multiple sets of the each set. I am not sure how to get around this issue.  

I can look at your code on Monday. Just raise your hand when you are given time to sork on the project.

- Can you also do a while loop in a list?

Do you mean list comprehension? While loops do not work in list comprehension.

Week 3
~~~~~~~

- When we are defining the prime number, is there any situations we can let prime = False?

It depends on how you want to setup your function

- I have never experienced project report and also not proficient in writing English. Would few errors or poor word selection in description impact grade a lot?

Did you look at the rubric on the class website? That contains all of the information

- Are project reports typically due the week they are released?

I usually release the project the week before it is due. Project one was a little a-typical, but that is the reason why we spent almost a full class working on it, and the project deadline was pushed forward. (We will also see short projects, that are introduced on the same week when they are due)

- In what cases is it more beneficial to use a while loop instead of a for loop? Can you use either one for any case or are there specific cases in which one should be used?

They are somewhat equivalent. I usually use a for loop when I know in advance how many iterations I need to do or if I have a list of elements I want to loop on. The while loop is usually used when you are iterating until a specific condition is verified.

- Around how many projects will we have this semester?

8 maybe 9

- How do we apply our lecture notes to the project? The exercises can be done with the lecture notes, but the actual project is completely different. What other resources are we allowed to use besides the ones already stated on the syllabus? 

You can use the functioncs we develop in class (including the lecture notes) in the project. You cannot copy code from the internet and use it on the project. You can however use the internet to understand how a python commend/functoin works. For example let's say that you forgot what ``list`` does. You can use google to find out. You cannot however look online how to write a function that computes false prime numbers, that is plagiarism.

- For the project, would you like us to do a lot of commenting within our code or worry more about explanations of what the functions do in markdown cells before or after the code itself?  For the primary decomposition of the false primes, would you like this to be returned as a list of lists, or should I print out each primary decomposition separately? How should this be formatted?

You need to do both.
For the primary decomposition you can return it as you prefer as long as it is clear and well formatted. A list of list does not look very well formatted in my opinion.

- Should we have a designated conclusion to our projects, or can we wrap up our findings in a briefer fashion?

You hsould have both. Analysis of the results right after each result and a conclusion which should be sort of a summery of your amin findings and a summary of what you didi in the project.

- a question that I would have is how can the speed of a program be measured to see what is a more efficent way to tackle a problem.

there is a module called ``time`` that can be used to time your code

- I have a little question about python logical and command. I may go to find some resource to help me.

What is the question?

- I am wondering is it possible for me to check how much time did my script run to get the final result?

there is a module called ``time`` that can be used to time your code

- What are the various methods of terminating a 'while' function? Is it just variations on the idea of  'break'?

To terminate a while loop break is the best option. If inside a function you could also use return (depending on what you are trying to do.

- How is pow(a,b,c) faster than  (a**b)%c?

I don't know the exact details, but ``pow`` has been optimized within python.

- Will we have time in class Monday to work on our projects?

No, on Monday we will start new material.

- What is the purpose of doing the ' ' ' comment as opposed to just a regular # comment?

It defines a comment that will be returned if using ``help()`` for that function

- What's the difference of while loop and for loop?

See above for the answer to your question.

- Can the for loop and while loop work together in one code?

yes. More info above in the answer to a similar question.

- While a function turns to False from True in a loop, do I have to put a `break` after the loop?

It depends on what you are trying to do. If you want to stop the loop yes.

- How can I make my code run faster? It currently doesn't have anything too special in it, but I think I need to iterate through less numbers when looking at false primes. 

The order of the operations matter. In general try to avoid nested loops, and try to repeat the code routines that take long the least you can.

- Is using LaTex notation in our markdown cells required for the project when notating a formula otherwise hard to write normally?

Yes! math formulas should look pretty

- I am still confused on what a false prime is and why it has to pass the congruence test to be a false prime. 

That is the definition of false prime.

- What does the while loop do? 

Iterates as long as the condition after ``while`` is True

- I'd like to write a program that runs a while loop and then returns a list. While the loop is running, if a certain condition P holds the loop will finish early and return the list it created. Assuming the loop doesn't finish early I'd like it to append an additional element before returning the list. Outside the body of the while loop I could write something like "if not P: ... return list" and have the program return a different list.   Is there a different way to accomplish the same thing? I'm wondering if there's a way append the additional element while still in the while-loop (although this element gets appended only if the while loop actually finishes).

I would put the append after the while loop, and I would use an if statement to append only when you need to. There are more convoluted ways to do that like ``exceptions`` that might work, but I am not sure you need to go there.

Week 2
~~~~~~~

- Will any of the quizzes be open note (being able to use our computers) or should we need to memorize all the codes?

Probably not

- Is there any situations like that we use if statement first, and then we use the for loop?

Yes, we might see some depending on the applications

- Will there be opportunity for extra credit in this course?

little, close to the end of the semester.

- The report introduction seems tough to write without rephrasing the problem statement's definition of prime numbers. Is this what you're looking for in the introduction?

You shoudl not rephrase the website introduction. You should try to explain in you own words what the project is about and what is the goal of the project.

- Will we ever be using the command "continue" within the context of this class because I'm not sure when would be best to use it

It might happen. In my experience I use ``break`` more often than ``continue``, but they are both useful.

- Will we be working on our projects in class, or is it mostly something to do on our own time?

We will use some of class time to work on the projects, but you are expected to spend a good amount of time outside class as well.

- Would we be able to practice more with Latex in class? 

If you are curious about how to do some LaTeX synthax properly I'll be very happy to talk about it at office hours

- As for the set up of our project submissions, can you assist us with formulating the proper verbiage you want with the actual code when we submit to you?

If you send me something via email I can give you feedback.

- When is the first project due?

Check the class website.

- I have question about how to use copy command in python.

``copy`` makes a copy of the copied variable. We will see why this is important on week 3

- I was wondering why a single quote mark doesn't designate a character type rather than just  another string? I know other languages make the distinction.

That is how it works in python. I am honestly not familiar with the examples from other languages that you are mentioning.

- Why did "venice" added twice after the code: myl2.append('venice') from line 24 week 2 note?

Because I ran the cell twice in class. (this is a very good question)

- Can ‘return' return anything, including things unrelated to 'def' function?

Yes, absolutely.

- Usually we round 4.45 to 4.6, but python rounds it to 4.4. Is it just how python works, or are there any other commands we should use? 

It depends from the representation that python does of the number 4.45. It is very likely  stored as a number slightly small than 4.45, and that is why it is rounded down. This is a very interesting topic, and I will be happy to elaborate more on it at office hours

- For the project, how much class time will be dedicated to working on it?

Some of it. I do not have a specific time in mind

- If you wanted to skip one instance of something, like 'f' in the suny buffalo example from class, so that you get suny bufalo instead of suny bualo, would you be able to do that? And how?

You could. For example you could have a variable ``tmp`` that becomes ``False`` after you skip ``f`` once. So once you are trying to skip the ``ff`` you would check if ``tmp`` is ``True`` or not, and skip only if ``True``

- Is it necessary to add parentheses to the things after `if`?

You not not need to add parenthesis for the boolean expression, but it is a good idea to do it to keep the code clean and avoid mistakes.

- In what order would loops execute if they were within each other? Does the loop inside another loop execute first, or vice versa?

The outer loop will start, then it will runn the inner-most loop for each instance of the outer-loop. Try to run nested loops, where the outer one loops on ``[1,2,3]`` and the inner-most loops on ``['a','b']``. Put a print expression inside the inner-most loop printing both variables you are looping on. This should help get an idea of how they work

- in range(a,b,c), c is how many number it will jump over right?

yes

- Is it possible to create a list and then store this list in a file on a computer which can then be called by a program? Perhaps we can store prime numbers in a text file and then have a program import this text file as a list. Having imported the list, the program could then check if a number is composite by checking if any of the prime numbers divide the given number. Also, would it be possible to write a program which calculates prime numbers and then store these numbers in a text file? 

Yes. We will see some examples in the next weeks.

- Can I write the if statement in the function?

Yes

- I am most curious about about the while loops and breaks, versus when to use a for loop. it seems that there may be overlapping situations for them.

You are correct, there are overlaps. We will talk about the ``while`` loop this week.




Week 1
~~~~~~~

- The two classes we have already done hold an overwhelming amount of workload. How/when will we get the hold of things? 

Starting from week 2 we will try to have a more interactive class where we practice a little bit more with the tools we explore.

- Is there a resource where you can find all the Latex commands in one place?

`**here** <https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf>`_ . Careful since there is more than you will ever need for this class

- How do the weekly quizzes function? Are we going to have to write down the code or will it be like this week where it's multiple choice and true/false?

You shoudl look at the sample quiz online.

- When we are solving the questions of LATEX, are we going to use the modules like import math?  What kinds of situation we can use the module as dir(math)?

LaTeX is not connected to the math module of python. LaTeX in not python and can be used outside of the jupyter-notebook environment.

- How many projects do we have this semester?

from 7 to 9 depending on how the semester proceeds

- what does f stand for when inserting values inside the bracket? ex) f' hi i am  {13} years old'

f tells python that is should format the string.
For example ``x=13``	

``f'I am {x} years old'`` 

will print 'I am 13 years old'

- I am wondering if I run the code "from math import *", then in the next cell, I run the code like "e = 1" if this will change the e value from the package? if so, how can I change the e value back to 2.718...

You should import ``e`` again from the math module

``from math import e``

- Is it possible to change a cell to markdown with the keyboard while the cursor is still blinking in that cell? I have found that the only way to change the cell after one is automatically created is to press "esc," then "M," and then "enter" to reenter the cell with the cursor. It feels a little clunky. Am I missing an easier way to do this?

If the coursor is blinking you cannot use keys to change the cell type because the keys will print in the cell. The way you are referring to is for me at leat the most conveninet way to change a cell to markdown. You can always use your mouse and chancge the cell type from the menu at the top.

- How should I go about staying on top of lesrning the code for this class? Is there a study method you recommend or should I be practicing outside of class, etc...

Practice and keep up with the material. You can find extra practice problems on line if you are struggling with some topics

- Is this class based more on coding or solving math related problems?

We will use coding and math together to solve problems

- My question is will we have to write code on paper for quizzes or will there be a computer aspect to them.  Should I be memorizing the Latex?

We will do the quizzes on paper. You should memorize some basic LaTeX commands

- What is the significance of Latex?
 
It allows to write math in a clean and organized format 
 
- This might be a bit dumb but I was kinda confused about this. Let's say I want to print 'hello'. If we can already do this: -->x='hello' -->x then at some places why do we use the str function, like this? -->x=str('hello') -->x I know that we get the same output either way, just wanted to be clear about what method to use, or if we use one thing separately to get a specific output further in python. 

`x='hello'` is already a string, so you do not need the `str` function.

- I'm confused on when floats/integers should be used instead of the other. Also when importing math, you stated be careful to overwrite and I was wondering what that meant. 

It depends waht type of variable you need to represent. An integer or a decimal. For the overwrite question, there is a question on e above that you shoudl look at.

- Do we have to install jupyter notebook using anaconda? I installed in onto my computer using brew and I was wondering if I will have to re-install it using anaconda. 

If jupyter notebook is running that is fine I guess. I woudl not re-install to avoid issues.

- I was curious why when doing simple arithmetic problems on python, it gives many decimal points. For example, we set x as 9.2, and when we did x-9, python returned an answer around .19999999993, but when we would normally do that, we would just get .2. 

That depends on the approximation and the way you display your answer usually if you explicitly use ``print`` the answer will look nicer.

- Is "print" perfect enough so that I can type "print" in every code?

Sometimes you might need ``display`` dependinf on what you are printing.

- When using LaTeX, do you want us to memorize the as much of the commands list as possible or do you have specific commands we should start to familiarize ourselves with more?

The ones I showed in class are enough (for this course)

- A question i would have is how to make latex writing more efficent to format large amounts of text all at once.

What do you mean? The LaTeX synthax works as I shoewd in class. There isn't any shortcut for that. 

- Is there an easier way to write Latex or is the dollar sign with all the extra symbols the only way?

The `$` is a way to tell jupyter now LaTeX is starting/ending. It is mandatory to use it

- Is there any difference between the double quotation marks and the single apostrophe quotation mark?

no

- What are some of the projects we can expect to see through t this semester ?

Spoiler alert! we will work with numbers, image manipulation, data analysis

- How does a computer do arithmetic? Given two non-zero integers m and n, we can verify if one divides the other by computing m/n. But assuming m/n is not an integer, this would give us much more information then we would need, since we are just trying to check if divisibility holds. Maybe there is a faster way to check if m/n is an integer that takes into account how a computer actually computes the quotient? This faster way would be beneficial if we were checking if some number N was prime and we needed to check if a set of prime numbers contained a divisor of N.

For divisibility it is very useful to check the integer division ``//``

- How often will we receive homework in this course?  Once a week?  Only occasionally? 

Sometimes there will be some small assignments (They are usually in class assignments)
