Answers to Weekly Summary questions
===================================

Week 2
~~~~~~~

- Will any of the quizzes be open note (being able to use our computers) or should we need to memorize all the codes?

Probably not

- Is there any situations like that we use if statement first, and then we use the for loop?

Yes, we might see some depending on the applications

- Will there be opportunity for extra credit in this course?

little, close to the end of the semester.

- The report introduction seems tough to write without rephrasing the problem statement's definition of prime numbers. Is this what you're looking for in the introduction?

You shoudl not rephrase the website introduction. You should try to explain in you own words what the project is about and what is the goal of the project.

- Will we ever be using the command "continue" within the context of this class because I'm not sure when would be best to use it

It might happen. In my experience I use ``break`` more often than ``continue``, but they are both useful.

- Will we be working on our projects in class, or is it mostly something to do on our own time?

We will use some of class time to work on the projects, but you are expected to spend a good amount of time outside class as well.

- Would we be able to practice more with Latex in class? 

If you are curious about how to do some LaTeX synthax properly I'll be very happy to talk about it at office hours

- As for the set up of our project submissions, can you assist us with formulating the proper verbiage you want with the actual code when we submit to you?

If you send me something via email I can give you feedback.

- When is the first project due?

Check the class website.

- I have question about how to use copy command in python.

``copy`` makes a copy of the copied variable. We will see why this is important on week 3

- I was wondering why a single quote mark doesn't designate a character type rather than just  another string? I know other languages make the distinction.

That is how it works in python. I am honestly not familiar with the examples from other languages that you are mentioning.

- Why did "venice" added twice after the code: myl2.append('venice') from line 24 week 2 note?

Because I ran the cell twice in class. (this is a very good question)

- Can â€˜return' return anything, including things unrelated to 'def' function?

Yes, absolutely.

- Usually we round 4.45 to 4.6, but python rounds it to 4.4. Is it just how python works, or are there any other commands we should use? 

It depends from the representation that python does of the number 4.45. It is very likely  stored as a number slightly small than 4.45, and that is why it is rounded down. This is a very interesting topic, and I will be happy to elaborate more on it at office hours

- For the project, how much class time will be dedicated to working on it?

Some of it. I do not have a specific time in mind

- If you wanted to skip one instance of something, like 'f' in the suny buffalo example from class, so that you get suny bufalo instead of suny bualo, would you be able to do that? And how?

You could. For example you could have a variable ``tmp`` that becomes ``False`` after you skip ``f`` once. So once you are trying to skip the ``ff`` you would check if ``tmp`` is ``True`` or not, and skip only if ``True``

- Is it necessary to add parentheses to the things after `if`?

You not not need to add parenthesis for the boolean expression, but it is a good idea to do it to keep the code clean and avoid mistakes.

- In what order would loops execute if they were within each other? Does the loop inside another loop execute first, or vice versa?

The outer loop will start, then it will runn the inner-most loop for each instance of the outer-loop. Try to run nested loops, where the outer one loops on ``[1,2,3]`` and the inner-most loops on ``['a','b']``. Put a print expression inside the inner-most loop printing both variables you are looping on. This should help get an idea of how they work

- in range(a,b,c), c is how many number it will jump over right?

yes

- Is it possible to create a list and then store this list in a file on a computer which can then be called by a program? Perhaps we can store prime numbers in a text file and then have a program import this text file as a list. Having imported the list, the program could then check if a number is composite by checking if any of the prime numbers divide the given number. Also, would it be possible to write a program which calculates prime numbers and then store these numbers in a text file? 

Yes. We will see some examples in the next weeks.

- Can I write the if statement in the function?

Yes

- I am most curious about about the while loops and breaks, versus when to use a for loop. it seems that there may be overlapping situations for them.

You are correct, there are overlaps. We will talk about the ``while`` loop this week.




Week 1
~~~~~~~

- The two classes we have already done hold an overwhelming amount of workload. How/when will we get the hold of things? 

Starting from week 2 we will try to have a more interactive class where we practice a little bit more with the tools we explore.

- Is there a resource where you can find all the Latex commands in one place?

`**here** <https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf>`_ . Careful since there is more than you will ever need for this class

- How do the weekly quizzes function? Are we going to have to write down the code or will it be like this week where it's multiple choice and true/false?

You shoudl look at the sample quiz online.

- When we are solving the questions of LATEX, are we going to use the modules like import math?  What kinds of situation we can use the module as dir(math)?

LaTeX is not connected to the math module of python. LaTeX in not python and can be used outside of the jupyter-notebook environment.

- How many projects do we have this semester?

from 7 to 9 depending on how the semester proceeds

- what does f stand for when inserting values inside the bracket? ex) f' hi i am  {13} years old'

f tells python that is should format the string.
For example ``x=13``	

``f'I am {x} years old'`` 

will print 'I am 13 years old'

- I am wondering if I run the code "from math import *", then in the next cell, I run the code like "e = 1" if this will change the e value from the package? if so, how can I change the e value back to 2.718...

You should import ``e`` again from the math module

``from math import e``

- Is it possible to change a cell to markdown with the keyboard while the cursor is still blinking in that cell? I have found that the only way to change the cell after one is automatically created is to press "esc," then "M," and then "enter" to reenter the cell with the cursor. It feels a little clunky. Am I missing an easier way to do this?

If the coursor is blinking you cannot use keys to change the cell type because the keys will print in the cell. The way you are referring to is for me at leat the most conveninet way to change a cell to markdown. You can always use your mouse and chancge the cell type from the menu at the top.

- How should I go about staying on top of lesrning the code for this class? Is there a study method you recommend or should I be practicing outside of class, etc...

Practice and keep up with the material. You can find extra practice problems on line if you are struggling with some topics

- Is this class based more on coding or solving math related problems?

We will use coding and math together to solve problems

- My question is will we have to write code on paper for quizzes or will there be a computer aspect to them.  Should I be memorizing the Latex?

We will do the quizzes on paper. You should memorize some basic LaTeX commands

- What is the significance of Latex?
 
It allows to write math in a clean and organized format 
 
- This might be a bit dumb but I was kinda confused about this. Let's say I want to print 'hello'. If we can already do this: -->x='hello' -->x then at some places why do we use the str function, like this? -->x=str('hello') -->x I know that we get the same output either way, just wanted to be clear about what method to use, or if we use one thing separately to get a specific output further in python. 

`x='hello'` is already a string, so you do not need the `str` function.

- I'm confused on when floats/integers should be used instead of the other. Also when importing math, you stated be careful to overwrite and I was wondering what that meant. 

It depends waht type of variable you need to represent. An integer or a decimal. For the overwrite question, there is a question on e above that you shoudl look at.

- Do we have to install jupyter notebook using anaconda? I installed in onto my computer using brew and I was wondering if I will have to re-install it using anaconda. 

If jupyter notebook is running that is fine I guess. I woudl not re-install to avoid issues.

- I was curious why when doing simple arithmetic problems on python, it gives many decimal points. For example, we set x as 9.2, and when we did x-9, python returned an answer around .19999999993, but when we would normally do that, we would just get .2. 

That depends on the approximation and the way you display your answer usually if you explicitly use ``print`` the answer will look nicer.

- Is "print" perfect enough so that I can type "print" in every code?

Sometimes you might need ``display`` dependinf on what you are printing.

- When using LaTeX, do you want us to memorize the as much of the commands list as possible or do you have specific commands we should start to familiarize ourselves with more?

The ones I showed in class are enough (for this course)

- A question i would have is how to make latex writing more efficent to format large amounts of text all at once.

What do you mean? The LaTeX synthax works as I shoewd in class. There isn't any shortcut for that. 

- Is there an easier way to write Latex or is the dollar sign with all the extra symbols the only way?

The `$` is a way to tell jupyter now LaTeX is starting/ending. It is mandatory to use it

- Is there any difference between the double quotation marks and the single apostrophe quotation mark?

no

- What are some of the projects we can expect to see through t this semester ?

Spoiler alert! we will work with numbers, image manipulation, data analysis

- How does a computer do arithmetic? Given two non-zero integers m and n, we can verify if one divides the other by computing m/n. But assuming m/n is not an integer, this would give us much more information then we would need, since we are just trying to check if divisibility holds. Maybe there is a faster way to check if m/n is an integer that takes into account how a computer actually computes the quotient? This faster way would be beneficial if we were checking if some number N was prime and we needed to check if a set of prime numbers contained a divisor of N.

For divisibility it is very useful to check the integer division ``//``

- How often will we receive homework in this course?  Once a week?  Only occasionally? 

Sometimes there will be some small assignments (They are usually in class assignments)
