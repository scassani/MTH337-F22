Answers to Weekly Summary questions
===================================

Week 1
~~~~~~~

- The two classes we have already done hold an overwhelming amount of workload. How/when will we get the hold of things? 

Starting from week 2 we will try to have a more interactive class where we practice a little bit more with the tools we explore.

- Is there a resource where you can find all the Latex commands in one place?

`**here** <https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf>`_ . Careful since there is more than you will ever need for this class

- How do the weekly quizzes function? Are we going to have to write down the code or will it be like this week where it's multiple choice and true/false?

You shoudl look at the sample quiz online.

- When we are solving the questions of LATEX, are we going to use the modules like import math?  What kinds of situation we can use the module as dir(math)?

LaTeX is not connected to the math module of python. LaTeX in not python and can be used outside of the jupyter-notebook environment.

- How many projects do we have this semester?

from 7 to 9 depending on how the semester proceeds

- what does f stand for when inserting values inside the bracket? ex) f' hi i am  {13} years old'

f tells python that is should format the string.
For example ``x=13``	

``f'I am {x} years old'`` 

will print 'I am 13 years old'

- I am wondering if I run the code "from math import *", then in the next cell, I run the code like "e = 1" if this will change the e value from the package? if so, how can I change the e value back to 2.718...

You should import ``e`` again from the math module

``from math import e``

- Is it possible to change a cell to markdown with the keyboard while the cursor is still blinking in that cell? I have found that the only way to change the cell after one is automatically created is to press "esc," then "M," and then "enter" to reenter the cell with the cursor. It feels a little clunky. Am I missing an easier way to do this?

If the coursor is blinking you cannot use keys to change the cell type because the keys will print in the cell. The way you are referring to is for me at leat the most conveninet way to change a cell to markdown. You can always use your mouse and chancge the cell type from the menu at the top.

- How should I go about staying on top of lesrning the code for this class? Is there a study method you recommend or should I be practicing outside of class, etc...

Practice and keep up with the material. You can find extra practice problems on line if you are struggling with some topics

- Is this class based more on coding or solving math related problems?

We will use coding and math together to solve problems

- My question is will we have to write code on paper for quizzes or will there be a computer aspect to them.  Should I be memorizing the Latex?

We will do the quizzes on paper. You should memorize some basic LaTeX commands

- What is the significance of Latex?
 
It allows to write math in a clean and organized format 
 
- This might be a bit dumb but I was kinda confused about this. Let's say I want to print 'hello'. If we can already do this: -->x='hello' -->x then at some places why do we use the str function, like this? -->x=str('hello') -->x I know that we get the same output either way, just wanted to be clear about what method to use, or if we use one thing separately to get a specific output further in python. 

`x='hello'` is already a string, so you do not need the `str` function.

- I'm confused on when floats/integers should be used instead of the other. Also when importing math, you stated be careful to overwrite and I was wondering what that meant. 

It depends waht type of variable you need to represent. An integer or a decimal. For the overwrite question, there is a question on e above that you shoudl look at.

- Do we have to install jupyter notebook using anaconda? I installed in onto my computer using brew and I was wondering if I will have to re-install it using anaconda. 

If jupyter notebook is running that is fine I guess. I woudl not re-install to avoid issues.

- I was curious why when doing simple arithmetic problems on python, it gives many decimal points. For example, we set x as 9.2, and when we did x-9, python returned an answer around .19999999993, but when we would normally do that, we would just get .2. 

That depends on the approximation and the way you display your answer usually if you explicitly use ``print`` the answer will look nicer.

- Is "print" perfect enough so that I can type "print" in every code?

Sometimes you might need ``display`` dependinf on what you are printing.

- When using LaTeX, do you want us to memorize the as much of the commands list as possible or do you have specific commands we should start to familiarize ourselves with more?

The ones I showed in class are enough (for this course)

- A question i would have is how to make latex writing more efficent to format large amounts of text all at once.

What do you mean? The LaTeX synthax works as I shoewd in class. There isn't any shortcut for that. 

- Is there an easier way to write Latex or is the dollar sign with all the extra symbols the only way?

The `$` is a way to tell jupyter now LaTeX is starting/ending. It is mandatory to use it

- Is there any difference between the double quotation marks and the single apostrophe quotation mark?

no

- What are some of the projects we can expect to see through t this semester ?

Spoiler alert! we will work with numbers, image manipulation, data analysis

- How does a computer do arithmetic? Given two non-zero integers m and n, we can verify if one divides the other by computing m/n. But assuming m/n is not an integer, this would give us much more information then we would need, since we are just trying to check if divisibility holds. Maybe there is a faster way to check if m/n is an integer that takes into account how a computer actually computes the quotient? This faster way would be beneficial if we were checking if some number N was prime and we needed to check if a set of prime numbers contained a divisor of N.

For divisibility it is very useful to check the integer division ``//``

- How often will we receive homework in this course?  Once a week?  Only occasionally? 

Sometimes there will be some small assignments (They are usually in class assignments)
