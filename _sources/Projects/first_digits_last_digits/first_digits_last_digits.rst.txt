First digits, last digits
=========================

.. rubric:: (due: Friday, December 2, 11:59 PM)

The goal of this project is to look for some patterns (or lack of
patterns) in data. More precisely, you will investigate how often various
digits appear as the first digit and the last digit of numerical data of
various kinds.

**Exercise 1.** Write a function ``fd`` that for a (positive or
negative) number returns the integer which is the first non-zero digit
of that number. If there are no non-zero digits the function should
return 0.


.. code:: python

    fd(123.45)




.. container:: output

    1



.. code:: python

    fd(-75)




.. container:: output

    7



.. code:: python

    fd(0.00345)




.. container:: output

    3



.. code:: python

    fd(0.0)




.. container:: output

    0



**Exercise 2.** Write a function ``ld`` that for a (positive or
negative) number returns the integer which is the last non-zero digit of
that number. If there are no non-zero digits the function should return
0.


.. code:: python

    ld(-123.45)




.. container:: output

    5



.. code:: python

    ld(42000.00)




.. container:: output

    2



.. code:: python

    ld(0.0)




.. container:: output

Project
~~~~~~~

1. Below are links to csv files containing numerical data coming from
various sources. Analyze how often each non-zero digit apprears as the
first digit of the data. You don't need to use all files, but you should
analyze several of them. Observe and investigate any patterns that may appear.
Perform the same analysis for the last non-zero digits. Use bar graphs
(or other plots) to illustrate results of your computations.


-  | :download:`NYSE\_2016\_03\_25.csv <NYSE_2016_03_25.csv>`
   | This file contains information about trades of stocks listed on
     the New York Stock Exchange on March 25, 2016. Interesting data to
     analyze are stock prices (opening price, closing price, low and
     high price during the day, high and low during the preceding 52
     weeks - you can select one or more of these) and trading volumes of
     stocks. This data was obtained from the website of `The Wall Street
     Journal <http://markets.wsj.com/usoverview>`__.

-  | :download:`country\_areas.csv <country_areas.csv>`
   | This file lists land areas of countries in square kilometers
     and in square miles. The data was obtained from the website of `The
     World Bank <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2>`__.

-  | :download:`country\_populations.csv <country_populations.csv>`
   | This file lists populations of countries for several years. You can
     choose to analyze data for one or more years. This data was
     obtained from the website of `The World
     Bank <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL>`__.

-  | :download:`airports.csv <airports.csv>`
   | This file contains information about airports and heliports around
     the world. Interesting numerical data here are elevations of
     airports above the sea level. This data was obtained from the
     website `ourairports.com <http://ourairports.com/data/>`__.

-  | :download:`library\_survey\_2013.csv <library_survey_2013.csv>`
   | This file contains results of the 2013 survey of public libraries
     in the United States. There is a lot of data here. Column headings
     are explained in :download:`this
     file <library_survey_2013_masthead.pdf>`. Interesting data
     to analyze includes the total number of print materials owned by
     each library (column BKVOL), the total number of annual library
     visits (column VISITS), the total annual library circulation
     (column TOTCIR), library operating expenditures (column TOTOPEXP)
     etc. Another interesting option is to extract building numbers from
     library street addresses (column ADDRESS). This data was obtained
     from the website of the `Institute of Museum and Library Services <https://data.imls.gov>`__.

-  | :download:`capital\_distances.txt <capital_distances.txt>`
   | This file lists distances (in kilometers) between capitals of
     countries. This data was obtained from the website of `prof.
     Kristian Skrede
     Gleditsch <http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~ksg/data-5.html>`__.


2. Below is a link to a file with text of all articles published by New York Times
on June 1, 2010. Find all numbers appearing in the text, and  analyze frequency
of first and last non-zero digits in these numbers. Compare this with the results
you obtained in part 1.
