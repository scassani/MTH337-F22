<h2>Week 10<a class="headerlink" href="#week-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will you assign project during Thanksgiving? Hope not..</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we able to delete certain lines or texts from the text files we make? This week we studied File operations, we learned how write several things in the file. But the question that I have is how to change several things in the file which I have already wrote before? When writing to the grocery.txt document, is there a way to delete the extra ‘chicken’ that was added to the document when the cell was ran twice?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We need to rewrite the file without the row we want to delete.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you demonstrate the method of filter you came up with to make the images clearer?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It was a median filter that was only fixing squares with no noise.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have specific times that you are available other than the set office hours?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually Thursday and Friday afternoon</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will our next project be based around our learning of the ‘open’ function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to drop a project grade?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. I can explain more in class. (Just remind me please.)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects more do we have?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3 more  (including project 6)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you only create text files or are there other types of files that you can create and write to as well?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Others as well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the next project code only?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Project 6, yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have to explore all of the images in project, or for example doing 3 fine?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2 of them is enough</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering how to save plotted graph (by matplotlib) in our local file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a command <cite>plt.savefig</cite></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>do we need to use close() if we just create a empty text.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. you should always close a flie.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does file operation exactly change the file in the computer?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a question I would have is what is the course of action when noise distortion happens that eliminates multiple pixels all next to each other? is there a way to reasonably restore this image?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>when the noise is too much, you might only be bale to recover part of the image.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I was wondering how people denoise images in the real world, and if the mean and median methods are actually used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the type of noise they might be used. I am not an expert in ‘real’ image denoising :(</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we using file operation for the next project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A little</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>when opening a file where does it locate the new file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>in the current folder.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You said we might have class Wednesday of Thanksgiving week. If we miss that day does it count as an absence? I live far away and will be leaving the day before.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have Wednesday off. So it will not be an absence</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can the txt. file make a copy like image?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make a copy of a file. From a quick google search it looks like the module <cite>shutil</cite> have sime functions that do so.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When calling a text file from a program, does the program just need to specify which directory the file is in to call it? Does this text file need to be converted into a list or numpy array in order to use it in the program? For example, if we were generating lists of prime numbers, it would be convenient to have a pre-existing list of prime numbers stored somewhere and then write a program which adds new prime numbers to this list. Although I’m not sure if the text file needs to be converted first in order for the program to read it and edit it. In the case of prime numbers, would a numpy array be more useful than a text file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends what you need to do with the data. Coth options might work.</p>
<p>Storing everything in a file is convenient when you have to stop working and pick up later. When you exit python, the variables are lost, but the file is safely stored.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we recieve an A on the project, does the extra credit have no affect?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For project 5 any extra credit (above A) will carry over to project 6 or 7</p>

<section id="week-9">
<h2>Week 9<a class="headerlink" href="#week-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are your only available office hours on wednesdays?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the regularly schedule OH yes. I am also available on appointment on other days on discord. Just send me an email to schedule</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If I enlarge the image, what is the value of the empty pixel on the edge side?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends from how big of a filter you are using. We will discuss it on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am still little confused with the mechanism of changing channels. What is exactly happening to original RGB by averaging them? I was thinking if the colors are changing by averaging them. Also, why are there 2 types of boundary to express colors [0,1] or [0,255]?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The diffent boundaries depends if you are sing integers of floats to store the numbers. When you take the average, you acr computinh the average of the color numerical values</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there ways we can edit photos such as making them brighter or changing the contrast?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. To make them brighter you need to increase the numerical values of the colors (careful not to go above the bound of 1 or 255)</p>
<p>To increase the contrast, you want to accentuate both bright and dark colors.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why is it so common for images to be stored in such different formats such as 1 or 3 channel and 0,1 versus 0,255. Why not standardize</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are just different formats. Think about Macs and PCs for examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When calling a function within a function, does the order in which you call them matter. For example if you want to take the output of a function f, and put that into another function g, how would that be written?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>g(f(x)), and yes order matters.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In this week, we studied a Boolean arrays and indexing. Can we using the Boolean arrays to find the color in the plt?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>what do you mean? You can use booleans for project 5. Is this your question?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you have office hours for longer next Wednesday by any chance?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How late are you thinking?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project I am not sure how to change it from a 3-channel to a single channel. Do you have any suggestions to help understand how to do that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways. The easier is to just grab one channel (green channel is best). Alternative you can combine them for example (R+G+B)/3</p>
<p>I can go over this again in class if you ask me.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we have a class on Monday of thanksgiving week?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, also on Wednesday I believe.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Could you please be more descriptive with what you would like included in the project details online?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I am not super descriptive for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The project exploration very much depends on what each one of you find interesting, so I do not want to add to many information and so limit exploration directions</p></li>
<li><p>Given that class attendance is mandatory, I give a lot of importance to the in-class discussion that we have on the projects. Some additional directions might just arise from in-class discussion and might not be originally included in the project.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Should the denoised image be perfectly clear? My results depending on the noise percentage gives a clear but somewhat muddled image.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no, since the data covered by the noise is lost and cannot be really recovered.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How are we supposed to include our selfies for the bonuses?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Read instructions on project page</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you demonstrate after project 5 is submitted, the version of code for the project which could be completed in one line?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I can explain it in class if you are interested. (It’s not exactly one line, but it avoids loops on the image)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there some sort of module that speeds up the process of changing the rbg values, that has a bunch of functions to do what we did this week instead of doing each part manually?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There might be, but I am honestly not famialiar with it. The way we did things in class is a useful exercise.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why there are 4 layers in some of the pictures? Does these 4 layers pictures still have RGB layers?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>transparency is the fourth layer</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If a function performs the same results, can I use the way I familiar with to do the project instead of the way you mentioned in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean? It depends what parts of the projects you are doing with the other function. You need to develop a median and mean filter from scratch using np.median and np.mean.
You should show me specifically what you mean before submitting the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the boolean array, how we change the values that are False.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>~b , if b is the boolean array will change True to False and viceversa</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we going to have time to work on Project 5 Monday and Wednesday this coming week?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since we’re removing noise from black and white images for the project, how difficult is it to remove noise from colored images? Can we remove noise from low quality images to create nicer looking images?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is similar, but using salt and pepper noise make things a little easier. If the image is low quality it depends on what way you are removing the nois, but in general there is a limit to how much we can improve the picture.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I want to know how project5 part2, how can we do to complete it? Can you show us the steps?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We talked about it in class last week, but we can go over it again on Monday. Just ask.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do the algorithms for converting to a mean/median matrix have a use outside of image filtering?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good question. There might be, but not that I am familiar with.</p>
</section>
<section id="week-7">
<h2>Week 7<a class="headerlink" href="#week-7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In this week we studied color in matplotlib, why we order the red, green and blue as [1,2,3]?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We order them as [0,1,2]. I believe that is the convention that is used. I do not know specifically why red is the first one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we feel as though we hit a wall with the extent of our coding skills, and the depth we can take this project, is that a good place to stop? I have a bunch of different plots with different vertices and some origin inclusion as well to change up the fractal patterns, and I found some interesting hypotheses, but they all seem out of reach in terms of skill level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think it would be a good place to stop</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is exactly transpose mean? Just switching rows and columns?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Like you said in office hours will we have to do an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester to get another quiz and one project dropped?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. (it is a survey not an extra assignment)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When doing the command img.show, what does the last value mean. In class we talked about the result of the value 3, but I got a value of 4 for my image, so I was confused as to what that meant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>transparency.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the analysis part of the project up to our discretion, or just what you tell us to look at during class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In class I try to give you some ideas, but then it is up to you to develop them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>My img.shape had 4 dimensions instead of 3. I am assuming this is because I used a partially transparent image for the example. Do you know if there are any functions that will add/remove transparency from a certain part of the image or do these functions only work with the red, green, blue scale?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can set transparency = 1 (or 255) to get rid of it</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering how to whats the difference between np.linspace and np.arange?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.linspace(a,b,n)</span></code> returns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code> equispaced nodes in the interval [a,b]</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.arange(a,b,c)</span></code> returns nodes (points) from teh interval [a,b) with a step of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we need to use matplotlib.cm in our next project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why divide the color by 255?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It has to do with the number of bits used. There are 8 bits, so 2^8 =  256 possible numbers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Towards the end of the lecture you mentioned the index for the RGB colors switched to be at the end of the list, can you explain why that is again?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>the first index gives the row, the second the column and the third the RGB.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What could I do if I want to append things to an array?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should not. You can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.append</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are color maps something used frequently in real world applications? Is this something that if we plan on coding in the future we will see again, or is it something we are mostly learning to use for projects in this class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Colormaps are widely used in the real world. Every time you are displaying complex results you might wanto to choose your color map.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have a question about the reshape, is this just make a list of numbers to multiple parts? what is reshape usually used as?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It changes the shape of the array. for example from 8x1 to 2x4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a question i would have would be what is the difference between 8 bit and 16 bit color in pcs if they are all just stored as [255,255,255]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Technically 16bit colors have way more (2^16) than 256 possible ‘shades’.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Could you please give the steps to use the image on a Mac again?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Download the image</p>
<p>go to Dowload folder</p>
<p>move image in current notebook directory</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you change the dimensions of an image on Python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Techincally yes. It is not straightforward as you might need to interpolate the image to fix the lost pixels</p>
<p>Can we insert picture in  our project by using imshow?</p>
<p>There is a different way to do it</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be any extra credit opportunities?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sort of, in one of the projects (5)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have question about logic to write p1 function</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to write a function that given a point in the polygon will follow the algorithm to</p>
<p>Choose a vertex at random</p>
<p>move f% of the distance between the verstx and the point to find p1</p>
</section>
<section id="week-6">
<h2>Week 6<a class="headerlink" href="#week-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we able to graph shapes on python that are not polygons?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean with curves? If you have an equation you can always plot it. There are also libraries that allows you to plot specific shapes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there anything that we should look out for when mixing arrays and lists in our code? Are there any functions that would not work well with arrays where we should switch back to lists or is python able to handle these changes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time python is able to do the conversion by itself, but it is not a great habit, sinc epython might behave in an unexpected way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For this week we studied the subplots, can we use subplots to make other figures such as triangles and squares?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sure</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is your advice on deciding whether an array or list is better for a code? Is an array better most of the time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to do operations all at once arrays are better. If you need to store different varaible types or you need to append, lists are better</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are you going to post our grades for the first project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are posted.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How frequently do these types of functions come up in the real world of coding?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which type? not clear.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What would the best way to study for this class be? I feel I know the basics well but implementing them in class is hard for me still when working on new functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Practice and keep up with the material. You can find extra practice problems online if you are struggling with some topics</p>
<p>As for project 3, can you describe pick_p0 again?</p>
<p>We want the function to pick a point at random inside the polygon with vertices <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code>. One way to code it is to generate points at random until the generated point is inside.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering is there any way that I can combine two generated graphs to one graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean with subplot or two curves on the same graph?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Does the time command track how long for the whole cell or just what’s in between the start and end?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>in-between start and end.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to have a specific seed for the random number generator?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random.seed()</span></code> allows you to set a specific random seed</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What and how will the project 3 plot will be as we run in big number?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Look on dircord. A classamte posted their results.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, do we have to use <cite>random</cite> to find a random point, or we can choose a point?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It has to be a random point</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are the future projects going to be more challenging than the ones we have already done?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On the project page it say use “contain_points( (x,y) )” to check if point is inside the path. Is this a function we have to create and why does it is have two sets of parenthesis?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contain_points</span></code> is available in python. (x,y) are the coordinates of the point.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we go over function pick_p1 on Monday class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>So what is the “.random” usually used for?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generate a random number. For example the movement direction of a cell can be, in some cases, approximated with a random number.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there another large import that presents more efficent ways to do simple tasks in python the way that numpy replaced many of the math options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not that I know of. (bu tI might be wrong)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m wondering if mathplotlib is the only module for graphing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, but is the most used. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bokeh</span></code> is another one</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I still have some question about random number and drawing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a question!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do calculations in random?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You cna use random numbers for calculations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any benefit to using C instead of Numpy? I understand that Numpy uses C code, but would it be more efficient to just use C?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>C has a different syntax, and is less user friendly. But numpy gives us the option to be as-fast-as C using python</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is numpy just more efficient than python’s data structures in general or is there something specific (like allocating the array in numpy) that is efficient rather than all the convenient functions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>operations on arrays will be faster in numpy than using a for loop.</p>

<h2>Week 5<a class="headerlink" href="#week-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the array we learned this week, we cannot combine one array with numbers by the array with strings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, they must have the same variable type</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is that possible to convert numpy array back to list? Also, I am still confused about how to use np.log1p function</p></li>
</ul>
<p>list(yourarray).
np.log1p computes the natural log of (x+1)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What plots other than line and scatter plots are we able to plot on python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>pie charts, histograms,….</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What would your best advice be on comments throughout the cells? What in your opinion is enough without causing for too much clutter and confusion?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It really depends on the functions. I would try to put a comment after each significant part of the function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how to change the size of the graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>plt.figure(figsize=(sizex,sizey))</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will numpy be used from here on out for all projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No. but we will use it in a few of them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many triples do we have to plot in the project? I have question about how many data points we need for draw a picture. What domain/range do you recommend when plotting a graph with many points (like the pythagorean triples)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I would go up to a,b=1000 but you can go higher if the code is not too slow</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For this week we studied the Numpy, so how can we use Numpy to do the division?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean in project 2? Yes you can use it</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many total projects will we have this semester?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This was asked in week 3. The answer is below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be learning in the future some way to test how “expensive” certain function are?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>time-wise I will show you on Monday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For what cases do we use np.ones or np.zeros?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a quick way to define a vector of ones or zeros. It is useful when you need to create large arrays and/or matrices</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the numphy gcd function as efficient as the one we developed during class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is a vectorial version of the regular gcd</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What’s the difference between plt.scatter and plt.plot? How different should the syntax be? Can we use that function in our project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use scatter. That is a scatter plot, and the synthax shoudl be similar.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using numpy regularly?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use it for a few projects.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m confused on the np.empty() function. I don’t understand what it does.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It creates an empty array. It reserves the space in the memory for an array. Then you can change it’s values later.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When having a large amount of string variables, would a list or array be more beneficial? I can tell that for numbers, an array would be more beneficial but I was curious about strings. How would you edit a specific string within an array?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot edit strings as they are non mutable. I think using lists would probably make things a littel easier, but it’s not a general rule.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What was wrong with “np.log([1,2,3])”? Why couldn’t we do that, and what would be the proper way to use that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>np.log is a vectorail function, so it would be more consistent to use an array as an argument. np.log(np.array([1,2,3]))</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there a built in fuction to graph in polar coordinates versus needing to convert it back to standard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.pythonpool.com/matplotlib-polar-plot/">try here</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we use our way to find the co-prime?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean? You shoudl define a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mygcd</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a simpler way to plot things that putting all the elements into lists and then plotting them together with something.plot? Is there a function that handles all the list comprehension for us?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the code in class, can the range become x instead of len(x)?</p></li>
</ul>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>for i in range(len(x)):</dt><dd><p>if x[i]%1==0:
x[i]=x[i]*2</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>it si not going to work. range needs a number and x is a list.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I found a different way to find Pythagorean triples than what was taught in class. Will that make a difference? Also, will we get back our project 1 grades before project two is due?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends what you mean with “a different way”. It is important that (1) the code you submit is your own and it is not copied from somewhere else, (2) you explain in a very detailed way the reasoning behind your work, (3) you cite/reference any external source where you got material and/or ideas from.</p>

<section id="week-4">
<h2>Week 4<a class="headerlink" href="#week-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I was wondering what the best way to write our ptriples function is, as far as using nested for loops or a diff way etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>nested loops will work very well for that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>From this code, even=[k for k in range(-99,100) if k%2==0] print(even)  What does it mean k for k?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It means append k to the list, for each k in range …</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>for drawing the pictures, there are so many plt methods such as plot, axis, yticks, figures. how we compare them when we drawing a picture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will just call what you need to use. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plot</span></code> to plot a curve, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">figure</span></code> to change the figure properties, and so on …
With a little practice it will become very natural.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are you more lenient on the first projects since we don’t have any feedback yet regarding what we are doing wrong. I’m also not sure how slices work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not really (maybe only a little). I have been going over what is expected for the project several times in class. However I plan to return you project 1 before project 2 deadline, so that you can have feedback to improve in project 2. For the slicing, there is some material on the class website, or you can come to office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you provide an example in class of part of code where it has all the elements for a decent project layout? Such as the intro to a specific cell or code, comments within the cell, and then if there needs to be an analysis after, what would you recommend us mentioning?  As for projects, when would you prefer us emailing them to you if we want to receive some feedback? Mostly in regards to the comments and analysis in-between the codes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of good projects are posted on the class website. You should look into that, and come to office hours if you have questions. To receive feedback on the project expect it can take me up to a couple of days to look into what you send me. So plan accordingly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where can we find all the list of commands we can use when building a graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>google “plt.plot” it should give you a place to start.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For this week, we studied “Plotting with matplotlib” and we tried to use this knowledge to draw a circle. Is there any solution to draw others diagram. For example, like triangle and square.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sure. For a square you just need vertical and horizontal lines, the triangle is a little trickier, but not too bad. You could sketch lines once you know the correct slope.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have a minimum/maximum size recommendation for graphs or any other stylization preferences?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually (6,6), or (8,6)  or (10,8) are good sizes. i look for completeness rather than style. Labels, title, lengend,…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there any sources we can use to do research for projects other than our notes from class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can look online to find more information on the topic of the project. However careful not to copy text/code</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a question i have would be why do the marker labels sometimes not work when makign a graph.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you show me an example?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When is the “;” required when writing the code for plots?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the last <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt</span></code> command you run</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering if I can add some notes or comments in the corner of the figure that is plotted by plt.plot() function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.text</span></code> command that allows for that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we have an answer sheet of weekly quiz?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can test all of the python part by just running the code in the notebook, and I will be happy to answer any question on the code at office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we have time to work on the project Wednesday in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will work on the project for sure on Monday. IDK about Wednesday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does compressing lists make them more efficient to run on Python, or is it mainly to make the code look cleaner?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cleaner code</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The part where we learnt how to print names with greetings, what would the could look like,  if we wanted to print each sentence in a new line?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That code was just building the list. To print each greeting on a new line you can do a loop with a print command inside.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it fine to use list comprehension if the codes are too long?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is not wrong, but the code will not look nice. Keep in mind that code readability is very important.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When plotting graphs, how do we name the axis’ and give the graph a title? How did you plot the x and y axis title?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>plt.ylabel for the y-axis, plt.title for the title</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the purpose and usage of -= and +=. I am having some issues figuring this out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x+=2</span></code> is the same as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x=x+2</span></code> just more concise.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We used a for loop to define a variable in a graph. Will we use a while loop to do something similar?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean list comprehension? While loops do not work in list comprehension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are the grade cutoffs on the website ever adjusted based on the class average?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, I do not curve grades</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do a project relating to manipulating a data set.  Like a data science based project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We might do something close to that. I haven’t decided yet what the last couple of projects will be.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In class I worked on the pythagorean theorem project code and successfully was producing pythagorean triples. But, I also had [0,0,0] as a triple and multiple sets of the each set. I am not sure how to get around this issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I can look at your code on Monday. Just raise your hand when you are given time to sork on the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you also do a while loop in a list?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean list comprehension? While loops do not work in list comprehension.</p>

<h2>Week 3<a class="headerlink" href="#week-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we are defining the prime number, is there any situations we can let prime = False?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on how you want to setup your function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have never experienced project report and also not proficient in writing English. Would few errors or poor word selection in description impact grade a lot?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you look at the rubric on the class website? That contains all of the information</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are project reports typically due the week they are released?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I usually release the project the week before it is due. Project one was a little a-typical, but that is the reason why we spent almost a full class working on it, and the project deadline was pushed forward. (We will also see short projects, that are introduced on the same week when they are due)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what cases is it more beneficial to use a while loop instead of a for loop? Can you use either one for any case or are there specific cases in which one should be used?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are somewhat equivalent. I usually use a for loop when I know in advance how many iterations I need to do or if I have a list of elements I want to loop on. The while loop is usually used when you are iterating until a specific condition is verified.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Around how many projects will we have this semester?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>8 maybe 9</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we apply our lecture notes to the project? The exercises can be done with the lecture notes, but the actual project is completely different. What other resources are we allowed to use besides the ones already stated on the syllabus?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the functioncs we develop in class (including the lecture notes) in the project. You cannot copy code from the internet and use it on the project. You can however use the internet to understand how a python commend/functoin works. For example let’s say that you forgot what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> does. You can use google to find out. You cannot however look online how to write a function that computes false prime numbers, that is plagiarism.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, would you like us to do a lot of commenting within our code or worry more about explanations of what the functions do in markdown cells before or after the code itself?  For the primary decomposition of the false primes, would you like this to be returned as a list of lists, or should I print out each primary decomposition separately? How should this be formatted?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You need to do both.
For the primary decomposition you can return it as you prefer as long as it is clear and well formatted. A list of list does not look very well formatted in my opinion.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Should we have a designated conclusion to our projects, or can we wrap up our findings in a briefer fashion?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You hsould have both. Analysis of the results right after each result and a conclusion which should be sort of a summery of your amin findings and a summary of what you didi in the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a question that I would have is how can the speed of a program be measured to see what is a more efficent way to tackle a problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there is a module called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time</span></code> that can be used to time your code</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have a little question about python logical and command. I may go to find some resource to help me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the question?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering is it possible for me to check how much time did my script run to get the final result?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there is a module called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time</span></code> that can be used to time your code</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are the various methods of terminating a ‘while’ function? Is it just variations on the idea of  ‘break’?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To terminate a while loop break is the best option. If inside a function you could also use return (depending on what you are trying to do.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How is pow(a,b,c) faster than  (a**b)%c?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know the exact details, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pow</span></code> has been optimized within python.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we have time in class Monday to work on our projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, on Monday we will start new material.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the purpose of doing the ‘ ‘ ‘ comment as opposed to just a regular # comment?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It defines a comment that will be returned if using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">help()</span></code> for that function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What’s the difference of while loop and for loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See above for the answer to your question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can the for loop and while loop work together in one code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. More info above in the answer to a similar question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>While a function turns to False from True in a loop, do I have to put a <cite>break</cite> after the loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on what you are trying to do. If you want to stop the loop yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can I make my code run faster? It currently doesn’t have anything too special in it, but I think I need to iterate through less numbers when looking at false primes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The order of the operations matter. In general try to avoid nested loops, and try to repeat the code routines that take long the least you can.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is using LaTex notation in our markdown cells required for the project when notating a formula otherwise hard to write normally?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! math formulas should look pretty</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am still confused on what a false prime is and why it has to pass the congruence test to be a false prime.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is the definition of false prime.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does the while loop do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Iterates as long as the condition after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> is True</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’d like to write a program that runs a while loop and then returns a list. While the loop is running, if a certain condition P holds the loop will finish early and return the list it created. Assuming the loop doesn’t finish early I’d like it to append an additional element before returning the list. Outside the body of the while loop I could write something like “if not P: … return list” and have the program return a different list.   Is there a different way to accomplish the same thing? I’m wondering if there’s a way append the additional element while still in the while-loop (although this element gets appended only if the while loop actually finishes).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I would put the append after the while loop, and I would use an if statement to append only when you need to. There are more convoluted ways to do that like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exceptions</span></code> that might work, but I am not sure you need to go there.</p>

<section id="week-2">
<h2>Week 2<a class="headerlink" href="#week-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will any of the quizzes be open note (being able to use our computers) or should we need to memorize all the codes?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably not</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any situations like that we use if statement first, and then we use the for loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we might see some depending on the applications</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be opportunity for extra credit in this course?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>little, close to the end of the semester.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The report introduction seems tough to write without rephrasing the problem statement’s definition of prime numbers. Is this what you’re looking for in the introduction?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You shoudl not rephrase the website introduction. You should try to explain in you own words what the project is about and what is the goal of the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we ever be using the command “continue” within the context of this class because I’m not sure when would be best to use it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It might happen. In my experience I use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> more often than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code>, but they are both useful.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be working on our projects in class, or is it mostly something to do on our own time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use some of class time to work on the projects, but you are expected to spend a good amount of time outside class as well.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would we be able to practice more with Latex in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are curious about how to do some LaTeX synthax properly I’ll be very happy to talk about it at office hours</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As for the set up of our project submissions, can you assist us with formulating the proper verbiage you want with the actual code when we submit to you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you send me something via email I can give you feedback.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When is the first project due?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Check the class website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have question about how to use copy command in python.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copy</span></code> makes a copy of the copied variable. We will see why this is important on week 3</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I was wondering why a single quote mark doesn’t designate a character type rather than just  another string? I know other languages make the distinction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is how it works in python. I am honestly not familiar with the examples from other languages that you are mentioning.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why did “venice” added twice after the code: myl2.append(‘venice’) from line 24 week 2 note?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because I ran the cell twice in class. (this is a very good question)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can ‘return’ return anything, including things unrelated to ‘def’ function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Usually we round 4.45 to 4.6, but python rounds it to 4.4. Is it just how python works, or are there any other commands we should use?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends from the representation that python does of the number 4.45. It is very likely  stored as a number slightly small than 4.45, and that is why it is rounded down. This is a very interesting topic, and I will be happy to elaborate more on it at office hours</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, how much class time will be dedicated to working on it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of it. I do not have a specific time in mind</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you wanted to skip one instance of something, like ‘f’ in the suny buffalo example from class, so that you get suny bufalo instead of suny bualo, would you be able to do that? And how?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You could. For example you could have a variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tmp</span></code> that becomes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> after you skip <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code> once. So once you are trying to skip the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ff</span></code> you would check if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tmp</span></code> is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> or not, and skip only if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it necessary to add parentheses to the things after <cite>if</cite>?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You not not need to add parenthesis for the boolean expression, but it is a good idea to do it to keep the code clean and avoid mistakes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what order would loops execute if they were within each other? Does the loop inside another loop execute first, or vice versa?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The outer loop will start, then it will runn the inner-most loop for each instance of the outer-loop. Try to run nested loops, where the outer one loops on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[1,2,3]</span></code> and the inner-most loops on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">['a','b']</span></code>. Put a print expression inside the inner-most loop printing both variables you are looping on. This should help get an idea of how they work</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in range(a,b,c), c is how many number it will jump over right?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it possible to create a list and then store this list in a file on a computer which can then be called by a program? Perhaps we can store prime numbers in a text file and then have a program import this text file as a list. Having imported the list, the program could then check if a number is composite by checking if any of the prime numbers divide the given number. Also, would it be possible to write a program which calculates prime numbers and then store these numbers in a text file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. We will see some examples in the next weeks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can I write the if statement in the function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am most curious about about the while loops and breaks, versus when to use a for loop. it seems that there may be overlapping situations for them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You are correct, there are overlaps. We will talk about the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop this week.</p>

<section id="week-1">
<h2>Week 1<a class="headerlink" href="#week-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The two classes we have already done hold an overwhelming amount of workload. How/when will we get the hold of things?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from week 2 we will try to have a more interactive class where we practice a little bit more with the tools we explore.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a resource where you can find all the Latex commands in one place?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">**here**</a> . Careful since there is more than you will ever need for this class</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do the weekly quizzes function? Are we going to have to write down the code or will it be like this week where it’s multiple choice and true/false?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You shoudl look at the sample quiz online.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we are solving the questions of LATEX, are we going to use the modules like import math?  What kinds of situation we can use the module as dir(math)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>LaTeX is not connected to the math module of python. LaTeX in not python and can be used outside of the jupyter-notebook environment.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects do we have this semester?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>from 7 to 9 depending on how the semester proceeds</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what does f stand for when inserting values inside the bracket? ex) f’ hi i am  {13} years old’</p></li>
</ul>
<p>f tells python that is should format the string.
For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x=13</span></code></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f'I</span> <span class="pre">am</span> <span class="pre">{x}</span> <span class="pre">years</span> <span class="pre">old'</span></code></p>
<p>will print ‘I am 13 years old’</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am wondering if I run the code “from math import <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>”, then in the next cell, I run the code like “e = 1” if this will change the e value from the package? if so, how can I change the e value back to 2.718…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should import <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code> again from the math module</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">math</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">e</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it possible to change a cell to markdown with the keyboard while the cursor is still blinking in that cell? I have found that the only way to change the cell after one is automatically created is to press “esc,” then “M,” and then “enter” to reenter the cell with the cursor. It feels a little clunky. Am I missing an easier way to do this?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the coursor is blinking you cannot use keys to change the cell type because the keys will print in the cell. The way you are referring to is for me at leat the most conveninet way to change a cell to markdown. You can always use your mouse and chancge the cell type from the menu at the top.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How should I go about staying on top of lesrning the code for this class? Is there a study method you recommend or should I be practicing outside of class, etc…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Practice and keep up with the material. You can find extra practice problems online if you are struggling with some topics</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is this class based more on coding or solving math related problems?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use coding and math together to solve problems</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>My question is will we have to write code on paper for quizzes or will there be a computer aspect to them.  Should I be memorizing the Latex?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will do the quizzes on paper. You should memorize some basic LaTeX commands</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the significance of Latex?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It allows to write math in a clean and organized format</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This might be a bit dumb but I was kinda confused about this. Let’s say I want to print ‘hello’. If we can already do this: –&gt;x=’hello’ –&gt;x then at some places why do we use the str function, like this? –&gt;x=str(‘hello’) –&gt;x I know that we get the same output either way, just wanted to be clear about what method to use, or if we use one thing separately to get a specific output further in python.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><cite>x=’hello’</cite> is already a string, so you do not need the <cite>str</cite> function.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m confused on when floats/integers should be used instead of the other. Also when importing math, you stated be careful to overwrite and I was wondering what that meant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends waht type of variable you need to represent. An integer or a decimal. For the overwrite question, there is a question on e above that you shoudl look at.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we have to install jupyter notebook using anaconda? I installed in onto my computer using brew and I was wondering if I will have to re-install it using anaconda.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If jupyter notebook is running that is fine I guess. I woudl not re-install to avoid issues.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I was curious why when doing simple arithmetic problems on python, it gives many decimal points. For example, we set x as 9.2, and when we did x-9, python returned an answer around .19999999993, but when we would normally do that, we would just get .2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That depends on the approximation and the way you display your answer usually if you explicitly use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> the answer will look nicer.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is “print” perfect enough so that I can type “print” in every code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you might need <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">display</span></code> dependinf on what you are printing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using LaTeX, do you want us to memorize the as much of the commands list as possible or do you have specific commands we should start to familiarize ourselves with more?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ones I showed in class are enough (for this course)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A question i would have is how to make latex writing more efficent to format large amounts of text all at once.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean? The LaTeX synthax works as I shoewd in class. There isn’t any shortcut for that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there an easier way to write Latex or is the dollar sign with all the extra symbols the only way?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <cite>$</cite> is a way to tell jupyter now LaTeX is starting/ending. It is mandatory to use it</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any difference between the double quotation marks and the single apostrophe quotation mark?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are some of the projects we can expect to see through t this semester ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Spoiler alert! we will work with numbers, image manipulation, data analysis</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does a computer do arithmetic? Given two non-zero integers m and n, we can verify if one divides the other by computing m/n. But assuming m/n is not an integer, this would give us much more information then we would need, since we are just trying to check if divisibility holds. Maybe there is a faster way to check if m/n is an integer that takes into account how a computer actually computes the quotient? This faster way would be beneficial if we were checking if some number N was prime and we needed to check if a set of prime numbers contained a divisor of N.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For divisibility it is very useful to check the integer division <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">//</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How often will we receive homework in this course?  Once a week?  Only occasionally?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there will be some small assignments (They are usually in class assignments)</p>
